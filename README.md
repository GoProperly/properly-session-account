# properly-session-account

Previous-generation authentication code used by [`admin-web-app`](https://github.com/GoProperly/admin-web-app).

This code should probably not be used for new projects; an approach similar to authentication in [`www`](https://github.com/GoProperly/www) (using AWS Amplify) is likely a better model to emulate.
